# Welcome to Beijing

Beijing is the capital of China and it has a long history. There are many places of interest in Beijing. As the saying goes, “He who doesn’t reach the Great Wall is not a true man.” In the north of Beijing, the Great Wall is a famous place for you to visit. It is a long wall with towers on it. People built it a long time ago with bricks and stones. You can enjoy great views from the wall. The Palace Museum is another interesting place you can’t miss. It is a place with many ancient buildings. If you are big fans of Chinese history, you must visit it. I’m sure it won’t let you down. Hope you’ll have a good time in Beijing.

 

# An Instruction of Shanghai

Shanghai is a very modern city in the world. It is in the east of China. The population of Shanghai is about 14 million. There are many interesting places in Shanghai, such as the Bund, the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, Yu Garden and so on. Tourists around the world like to visit it. The public transportation is very convenient. You can travel around by bus, ferry, underground, light rail and so on. Shanghai is getting more and more beautiful. I like Shanghai very much.

 

# A Holiday Plan

The winter holidays are coming. I am going to visit Beijing with my parents. We will visit the Palace Museum. I want to know the history of China. We will also visit some other nice places, such as the Great Wall, the Summer Palace and Tian’anmen Square. We will see soldiers raising the Chinese national flag in the square. We’ll take some photos at the Great wall. Beijing is a modern and beautiful city. I’m sure we will have a wonderful time.

 

# Dogs are our favourite animals

Dogs are men’s best friends. They give us a lot of help. In ancient times, they helped men hunt animals and kept their caves safe. Now, dogs help the police to catch thieves and find missing people. What’s more, some dogs can even help blind men. They show them the way and do a lot of things for them. We call this kind of dogs guide dogs, and they are blind men’s eyes. In a word, dogs are not only our pets, but also our best friends!

 

# I have a pet cat

Like most children, I have a pet. It’s a cat. I call her Mimi. My grandma gave her to me as a birthday present. She is black and white. She’s really lovely. When I come back home, she usually runs to me and plays with me. When I am doing my homework, she lies under the table quietly. She loves to look at herself in the mirror. She keeps clean and enjoys being washed. She is such a nice and lovely cat. I like her so much.

# My Pet

My pet is a puppy called Sam. It is white with black spots. I look after it carefully. I feed it special dog food for puppies. I give it a basket to sleep in. I hold it carefully with both hands. I always play with it and take it to the garden for a walk. It brings me happiness and teaches me how to be a kind and responsible child. We are good friends.

 

# My introduction

I’m a girl called Kitty. I’m 13 years old. I come from Shanghai. I’m 160cm. I hope I will be taller. There are four people in my family. They are my parents, my sister and me. My classmates like me because I am an outing kid. I study in Changdao Middle School and it’s near my home, so I always walk there. There are nine subjects in this term. But my favourite subjets are Maths and History. I always play basketball with my classmates after school.

# I’d like to be your penfriend

Penfriends International sent your name to my school. I would like to be your penfriend. I am a girl from China. I am Shanghainese. I am twelve years old. There are three people in my family. We have a pet cat. Her name is Alice. I go to school on weekdays. I am a Grade 7 student. My favourite subjects are Maths and Chinese. I like my teachers and they are all kind and patient. I like swimming, playing badminton and watching movies. I am really eager to know friends from other countries. Please write soon and tell me about yourself.

 

# My dream

Everyone has his own dream. Some people want to be doctors. Others hope to be scientists. My dream is to become a teacher. Teachers can not only teach us many things at school, but also teach us how to learn. Thanks to them, we get knowledge. And at the same time, we learn how to live a happy life. They spend most time on their students. They are great in my eyes. I hope to be a teacher because I admire teachers. I know it is not easy to make my dream come true. But I decide to study harder from now on.

 

# My dream job

I’m going to be a doctor when I grow up. I was born in a family of doctors. My parents are always busy working for many sick people. Mum and Dad always say that helping these people makes them happy. I also want to help as many people as I can in my life. I must study hard from now on and I’m going to study medical science when I go to college. I believe I can be successful.

 

# My dream job

My dream job is to be a PE teacher. I would like to work in a beautiful school with a good playground. As a PE teacher, I should teach my students how to do the warm-up exercises before doing sports. Besides, I should make sure they are not hurt during the activities. In order to be a PE teacher, I will do more exercise to make myself stronger.

 

# On my way to school

I live in the suburbs so it takes me a long time to get to school. I go to school on foot, then by bus. I t takes me more than an hour to get to school. I see many trees and flowers when I am walking to the bus stop. I see a few policemen controlling the traffic when I am on the bus. I see many street cleaners cleaning the street when I am walking to school. What a long journey it is!

 

# My ideal flat

I would like to live in the suburbs because it is quiet and peaceful. I would like a flat with a big living room, a big dining room, a big kitchen, and three bright bedrooms. I would like to put some beautiful furniture into it. For example, I will put a sofa next to the window in the living room and a TV set opposite the sofa. I will also put a big and warm rug between them. What’s more, I will put some decorations in each room. This is my ideal flat.

# I like living in the suburbs

I have just moved to Water Bay. My new flat is in the suburbs, so it’s very quiet and peaceful. There isn’t much traffic. There are not any shops or restaurants. There are a lot of trees, flowers and birds. There is a beach at the bottom of some steep steps. I usually take Peter and Mary to the beach at weekends. We often read storybooks at home. And sometimes we watch stars at night. I think life in the suburbs is so pleasant and relaxing that I like living in the suburbs very much.
